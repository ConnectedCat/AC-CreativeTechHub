    <h2>Creativity and Technology in MDP</h2>
    <p>Although each curricular piece of MDP has a distinct emphasis and pedagogical approach, a critical investigation of technology's creative potential runs through the entire MFA program. In other words, the Creative Technology classes are not the only place in MDP that deals with 'creative technology,' in theory and in practice.</p>
    <p>As students advance through the program, culminating a thesis project, they will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strategically identify, evaluate and integrate existing technologies into their creative practice</li>
        <li>Grasp fundamental CS concepts of algorithmic thinking, data, physical and spatial computing, so they can critically craft prototypes, prompts and probes across a range of canvases</li>
        <li>Identify and adopt the appropriate level of fidelity for their creative practice, i.e. know which platforms and level of functionality are relevant to discovery, experimentation, concept ideation, proof of concept and development</li>
        <li>Situate and craft the appropriate and relevant type of project for their creative practice, e.g. proof of concept through functional prototype, as strategically necessary</li>
        <li>Research, understand and critically evaluate the implications of existing and emerging technologies in the framework of social, ethical, economic, HCI and art/design and aesthetic ecologies.</li>
        <li>Self-direct their learning and adoption of new technologies through studio, labs, mentorship, online, self-study, etc.</li>
        <li>Communicate and collaborate with technology domain experts</li>
        <li>Align technology as a mode of inquiry with conceptual framing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Working Culture, Assessment </h2>
    <p>Although the Creative Technology class includes weekly assignments and a fair amount of specific technical instruction, it is primarily organized to be a 'creative workshop,' where students can experiment and contemplate technology as part of their practice, as well as a space to review lots of technology-related work by other designers and artists. Projects will have deadlines with presentations and critical discussions, but we de-emphasize these events as major delivery milestones. (This does not mean we do not expect students to produce some formally and conceptually refined pieces at several points in their journey through this class.) We are concerned, primarily, about how students are documenting and reflecting on their investigations as they go along. At the start of the term, students will set up a GitHub repository, which they will use as a space for this.</p>

    <p><strong>CT Projects</strong> focuses on engaging with technology as a generative exercise ("making to think"). Each project lasts 1-3 weeks, and typically comprises practical workshops framed within an open-ended creative brief. The projects are designed to allow students to dive in and create, regardless of their level of experience and familiarity working with code or electronics. The projects are open to all MDP students, space permitting.</p>

    <p>In Concept year, The Creative Technology class includes a weekly seminar, in addition to the series of hands-on creative projects. The seminar and projects are run as separate entities, but sometimes there is a topical alignment between them.</p>
    <p><strong>CT Seminar</strong> introduces relevant domains, concepts, methods, critical positions, through presentation and discussion of readings, projects and practices. The syllabus is diverse but focused, and draws from fields of Interaction Design, Interactive Media Arts, and Science Technology Society studies (STS).</p>
